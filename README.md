## 🔍 Project Overview

This project develops a **robust, segment-specific time series forecasting framework** to predict NVIDIA’s Sales Revenue across multiple regions and product categories.

Instead of applying a single global model, we implemented a **dynamic model selection strategy**, choosing the best-performing model for each Region–Product combination based on out-of-sample performance.

Three model classes were rigorously compared:

- **ARIMA (2,1,0)** – Autoregressive statistical baseline  
- **ARIMAX (2,1,0)** – Incorporating Marketing Spend as an exogenous variable  
- **XGBoost** – Machine learning approach capturing nonlinear patterns

## 🎯 Objectives

- Forecast NVIDIA Sales Revenue
- Quantify the impact of Marketing Spend
- Compare statistical vs machine learning approaches
- Deliver actionable business insights
- Perform segment-level model optimization

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset simulates historical ERP transactional records (1993 onward), including:

- Date
- Product Category
- Region
- Sales Revenue (Target Variable)
- Marketing Spend (Exogenous Variable)
- Customer & product-level attributes

Each Region–Product combination was modeled as an independent time series, resulting in a panel of segment-level forecasts.

## 🧹 Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

- Daily data aggregated to **monthly frequency**
- Log transformation of Sales Revenue (variance stabilization)
- Standardization (Z-score) of Marketing Spend
- Chronological 12-month out-of-sample test split
- Creation of lag features for ML modeling

## ⚙️ Modeling Framework

| Model | Type | Strength |
|-------|------|----------|
| ARIMA (2,1,0) | Statistical | Captures autocorrelation |
| ARIMAX (2,1,0) | Causal Statistical | Quantifies marketing impact |
| XGBoost | Machine Learning | Handles nonlinear interactions |

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Performance was evaluated using:

- MAE (Primary selection metric)
- RMSE
- MAPE
- AIC / BIC (for ARIMA & ARIMAX)
- Ljung-Box test for residual diagnostics

Final model selection was based on **lowest out-of-sample MAE**, supported by stability diagnostics.

## 🏆 Key Findings

✔ No single model dominates across all segments  
✔ ARIMAX outperformed in marketing-sensitive regions  
✔ XGBoost excelled in nonlinear demand patterns  
✔ ARIMA performed best in stable historical-demand segments  

The results confirm that **forecasting performance is segment-dependent**, validating the need for a dynamic selection strategy.
